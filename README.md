# FunctionalTCPServer
FunctionalTCPServer uses the power and fancyness of Java 8 to realize a lightweight client-server library you can use to implement message based protocols in your own distributed system projects.

It is
- functional
- generic
- object oriented
- multithreaded
- easy to use
- less than 10 KB in size

***
## What can I do with it?
You can not only use it for simple things, such as text based protocols, but also for advanced stuff like sending complex Java objects, altering them and on the server side and then send them back to the client.  
Just use it as a library in your own project.
***
## Usage
Please refer to the Javadoc for usage. Also, you can see some simple examples in the included tests.
